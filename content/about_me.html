        <p>As a high school student, I was contemplating what career best suits me. After doing some deep research, I discovered that salary and need for computer scientists would rise in the decade to come. The extracurricular activities at my high school in Cotulla taught Java; this was not a great start to even begin with the basics and fundamentals. I then began my journey at Austin Community College as a river-bat! The first and only two years I enrolled in courses here were to gain credits to be able to transfer. In these two years, I found a new love and passion for programming. I was taught Python in fundamentals I, and C++ in fundamentals II and Data Structures. I felt myself growing into likeness with what being a computer scientist had to benefit from and offer. A huge thanks are given to Bob Comer and Paul Thayer!</p>
