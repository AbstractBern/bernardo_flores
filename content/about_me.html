        <p>As a high school student, I was contemplating what career best suits me. After doing some deep research, I discovered that salary and need for computer scientists would rise in the decade to come. The extracurricular activities at my high school in Cotulla taught Java; this was not a great start to even begin with the basics and fundamentals. I then began my journey at Austin Community College as a river-bat! The first and only two years I enrolled in courses here were to gain credits to be able to transfer. In these two years, I found a new love and passion for programming. I was taught Python in fundamentals I, and C++ in fundamentals II and Data Structures. I felt myself growing into likeness with what being a computer scientist had to benefit from and offer. A huge thanks are given to Bob Comer and Paul Thayer!</p>
        <p>After careful consideration, I then transferred to the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Go Runners! The path I took was not an easy one. In my time here, I went into bad academic standing multiple times, reached the state limit of withdrawals for an academic career, and had to retake a few classes multiple times. This ultimately helped build my character and discover new ways of approaching learning and connecting with others to get things done. I believe it was too late when I finally realized creating study groups, and building friendships would help in becoming an outstanding student. Nevertheless, in my last year as a roadrunner, I did exactly that. It is fair to say everyone in the department as a student gets a broad understanding of what computer science is, and not all digest the information the same. I left the department with plenty of insight and friends that I can cherish beyond my academic career.</p>
        <p>I am 23 years old. If I am not in my house watching horror movies, or working on anything computer science related, then I am out enjoying what life has to offer! I can easily get along with anyone who has the same kind of easy-going personality and desire to create a mosh-pit.</p>
